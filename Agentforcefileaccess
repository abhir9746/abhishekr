Logic â€“ Agentforce Accessing Files and Retrieving Output
1.	Create a Flow

3.	Get ContentDocument Record
o	Add another Get Records element on ContentDocument.
o	Filter with:
Id Equals {!ContentDocumentLink.ContentDocumentId}

________________________________________
ðŸ§  Sample Prompt (Flex Type with File Input)
You are responsible to identify the content present in {!$RecordSnapshot:File.Snapshot} and you need to understand the context of the document. Based on the type of document and the content you will be summarizing the data from file and will share it back to user. The summary should contain the information present inside the file. Key data should be reflected in bold. The results should be catchy and this should give an entire view on the document.
Note: The flow shall be modified if we need data from multiple files. Currently I used a single file.
